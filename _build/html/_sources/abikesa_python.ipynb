    "Creating a homework assignment for graduate students that focuses on nested, hierarchical, multilevel, and longitudinal data requires tasks that challenge their understanding and application of these concepts. Hereâ€™s an assignment that should serve the purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment: Analyzing Hierarchical and Longitudinal Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is to develop your understanding and skills in handling nested, hierarchical, multilevel, and longitudinal data structures. You will analyze a dataset that exhibits these characteristics using Python and relevant libraries such as `pandas` and `statsmodels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**  \n",
    "You are provided with a dataset (`stsrpos.csv`) containing information about medication prescriptions across various patients and time periods. The columns include:\n",
    "- `usrds_id`: The ID of the user/patient.\n",
    "- `gnn`: The generic name of the medication.\n",
    "- `srvc_dt`: The service date of the prescription.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.\n",
    "   - Convert the `srvc_dt` column to a proper date format.\n",
    "   - Create a new column representing the year and month of the service date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Descriptive Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Calculate and visualize the distribution of prescriptions over time.\n",
    "   - Identify the most frequently prescribed medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Data Analysis:**\n",
    "   - The data is inherently hierarchical with patients nested within prescription dates.\n",
    "   - Determine the number of unique patients and prescriptions in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Explore the variability in the number of prescriptions per patient over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Longitudinal Data Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Select a subset of patients who have at least five prescriptions over the observation period.\n",
    "   - Examine how the frequency of their prescriptions changes over time.\n",
    "   - Plot these changes for at least three selected patients to visualize their prescription trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multilevel Modeling:**\n",
    "   - Build a simple linear mixed-effects model to predict the frequency of prescriptions using a random intercept for patients.\n",
    "   - Interpret the results, focusing on the significance of the random effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Discussion:**\n",
    "   - Discuss the challenges and insights of working with hierarchical and longitudinal data.\n",
    "   - Reflect on how multilevel modeling can help address issues of data dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**  \n",
    "Submit a Jupyter notebook containing all code, outputs, visualizations, and a discussion. Make sure to clearly comment your code and provide insightful interpretations of your results.\n",
