# just did a massive cleanup of repo:

After you've cleaned up your directory by removing the duplicate files, you need to commit these changes to your Git repository to reflect the updates. Hereâ€™s a straightforward process for committing the changes to your Git repo:

### Step 1: Check the Status of Your Repository

First, make sure you're in the root directory of your Git repository, and then run the following command to see which files have been deleted:

```bash
git status
```

This command will show you the changes in the repository, including files that are no longer tracked because they've been deleted.

### Step 2: Stage the Changes

You can stage all the deletions at once using the following command:

```bash
git add -u
```

The `-u` option with `git add` stages all modifications and deletions, but not new files (if there are any new files you want to commit, use `git add <file>` or `git add .` to add everything).

### Step 3: Commit the Changes

Once you have staged the changes, commit them to the repository:

```bash
git commit -m "Removed duplicate files"
```

Use a commit message that describes what you did, so you or anyone else working in the repository can understand the history.

### Step 4: Push the Changes

Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

If you're working on a specific branch (other than the default `main` or `master`), you'll need to specify the branch in your push command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Optional: Check the Repository Health

After making significant changes like removing files, it's good practice to check the integrity and status of your Git repository:

```bash
git status
git log
```

These commands help you ensure that the repository is in the desired state and that the history looks correct.

### Wrap-Up

These steps will update your Git repository by removing the unwanted files permanently, keeping your project clean and manageable. Always ensure that these deletions are intended as they affect both your local and remote repositories once pushed.
